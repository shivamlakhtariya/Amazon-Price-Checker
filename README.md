# Amazon-Price-Checker

Simple function that will get product prices and other information from product URLs provided in a csv file.
Fetches prices from Amazon India.

# Getting Started
Once you add a few URL's with the products you want to follow, Amazon_Scraper.py will take care of the rest.
Make sure to use this folder structure to avoid issues with file paths.

# Librarues
glob : Package that allows us to get things like a list of different file names inside a folder.(Its helpful when python creates different file in folder)
bs4 : for web scrapping
request : Will take care of URL.
pandas

# Decryption of main file
Here I have created "single product scrapper.ipynb" with detail description of each step for better understanding.

# How to use it
"Amazon_scrapper.py" is a main file.For file formatting I would suggest you to download whole repository as a same formate as given here. Put this repo in the main folder where your jupiter notebook is. Or else change the path according to your device.

For checking price in regular interval For windows user(As I am) use Task Scheduler and this file will work. Give some time to python for generating output and depending on your Internet conncetion it will generate output.

You can add as many products link as you want in "TRACKER_PRODUCTS.csv" (Which is in tracker folder)
make sure you check file formate before using it.

If you have more efficient way to use it for make it please let me know. My email id is on my profile check. I would love to know your point.
